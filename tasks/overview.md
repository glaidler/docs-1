# Overview

Tasks are a 'job, instruction or action' and can be related to any item on Harbour Assist \(Boat, Account, Asset or Order\). They can be used to ask a User or Team to contact the account holder, make changes to an Account or Order, carry out maintenance to an Asset, to alert a user of a problem with an Asset that requires repair etc. They are assigned to a User or a Team and are tracked through to completion.

Viewing the tasks of a User or Team can help with workload management - you can see what they need to do on a daily basis via an outlook-style calendar.
