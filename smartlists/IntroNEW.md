# What is a Smart List

The clue is in the name - Smart Lists are lists that are purely defined by the data held within Harbour Assist.  As the data changes, the lists are automatically updated without any intervention.  So if you have a list that shows all accounts with a debt over 90 days, once that debt is paid the account is removed from the list automatically.  Likewise if you have an account with a debt that becomes 90 days overdue, they are added to the list. These lists are Smart!

Smart Lists can be used purely to gather statistics or to send bulk communications to groups of customers.

Following our re-development of Smart Lists you can now create lists using any of the following record types:-

- Accounts
- Assets
- Boats
- Communications
- Documents
- Occupancies
- Orders
- Payments
- Tasks
- Waiting List Items

This gives you huge flexibility to mine your data and find information.  You'll be able to use our intuitive Query Builder to create your perfect list, but there's bound to be some combinations we haven't thought of yet, so please do let us know if you come across anything by raising a help ticket within the system.
