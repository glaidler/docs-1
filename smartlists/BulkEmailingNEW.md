Complete the following steps:-

1. Who should be included in the communication.
2. Is this an Operational or Marketing communication? - remember if it's Marketing you should only send to those who have opted in to receive the communications. You will be prompted to either give an Operational justification or to choose which Consent Groups the communication should go to.
3. Inclusions and Attachments - 
   - Do you want to include additional email addresses that are on Accounts - if so tick the box.
   - Add any attachments that need to be sent with the email.
4. Give your email a subject - this will be displayed to the customer, so make sure it's something sensible.
5. Choose which template to use if you want to use one.
6. Create the body of your email.
