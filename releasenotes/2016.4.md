# 2016.4

## v2016.4 - November

A smaller release with a few usability improvements and a number of bug fixes.

### New Boat Change \#\#\#

When adding a new boat to an Account, previously HA flagged validation errors as you typed in the name etc. Now a popup captures the mandatory fields before saving the Boat so these messages don't appear.

### Small Changes \#\#\#

* The _move licence_ option has now been enabled when performing an entire occupancy move.  Previously it was only enabled on a split.
* Time picker has been added to Financial Tools page, to allow scenarios when banking is done part-way thorugh the day or shift change-overs need more accurate filtering.
* Adding an Occupancy from the Asset List now defaults to the Licence holder.
* Boat Stickers renamed to Plaques with new icon.

### Bug Fixes \#\#\#

* Pagination now visible on Smart lists
* Bug sometimes led to Order Types tariffs not being displayed.
* Smart lists dropdown fields weren't refreshing in some scenarios.
* Asset inpsection now showing component correctly.
* When capturing an "tickbox" check during an inspection, the clickable area is bigger.
