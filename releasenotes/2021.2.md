## Smart Lists Rebuild \#\#

When we built smart lists back in 2016, we knew we had something people _may_ find useful, and it has become central to reporting and communications for many marinas. We've been working for the best part of a year re-building it to be more immediately more useful, as well as providing a cornerstone of our _automation_ strategy long into the future. You should see the first fruits of this strategy later this year.

## New Record Types \#\#

The original Smart Lists allowed you to query Account Records using a variety of filters across lots of records, but it became limiting when you wanted, for example, to reference a boat name in an email as the customer may have multiple boats. For this reason, you can now drill into lots of different Record Types, and explore the data via criteria relevant to the Record. All record types allow bulk communicating with the associated Account record & allow you to merge fields into the email.

**Asset** - Filter by Type, Region, Area, Site, License Status, Occupancy Status etc.

**Boats** - Type, Dimensions, location etc.

**Communications** - Filter by Channel, Dates etc.

**Documents** - Filter by Expiration Date, Account Type, Document Type etc.

**Occupancies** - Filter by Type, Date, Account Type etc.

**Orders** - Filter by Status, Account Type, Amount, Payment Status, Tax point dates etc.

**Payments** - Filter by Payment Method, Amount, Account Type, Dates etc.

**Tasks** - Filter by Task Type, Assignee, Due dates etc.

**Waiting List Items** - Filter by Waiting list, added on, whether associated with boat etc.

## New Layout and Interface \#\#

We've updated the user interface when you're building a Smart List; rather than showing the entries \(which is of limited use\), we show some summary Counts, Sums and Averages which make sense for the Record Type you're composing for; for example in _Order_ smart lists, we show a breakdown of how many are paid/unpaid with their value.

Once you've created a Smart List that makes sense for your organisation, you can quickly see how the entries are distributed across key elements. You can click on a link to "drill into" this criteria easily.

## New Query Builder \#\#

The query builder has been re-built for modern browsers and to work better on mobile devices.

## New Customisation options \#\#

* **Private Lists** - You can now control whether the list is "just yours" or "global"; meaning you can create your own library of useful lists without cluttering everyone's else's workspace.
* **Variable column visibility** - Control which columns are visible on a list-by-list basis;  we realise that each list has a different purpose, and that purpose will dictate the right columns to show.

## New Bulk Email + SMS Tools \#\#

* The Email and SMS editors have been updated, with simple merge-field selection.
* The bulk engine has been re-written to work on an extensible workflow engine.  Whilst this won't make any difference yet, this is fundamental to the future of automation of Harbour Assist, we'll be sharing more on this later this year. 

## Other Enhancements \#\#

* **Multiple Email Addresses per Account** - You can now store multiple email addresses against each account and control whether they are automatically CCd on bulk/ad-hoc emails.
* **Page refreshes** - alongside feature building, we've spent a lot of time re-building pages to work better on mobile devices and requiring less code.  There are too many to list here.
