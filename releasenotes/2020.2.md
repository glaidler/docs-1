# v2020.2 - March \#

## Covid-19 \#\#

We just wanted to let you know that we are working as usual on Harbour Assist. We have always been a 100% remote-working company, so we haven’t had to put any special measures into place.

This release includes features that will help you serve your customers from a distance, like Quick Pay, SMS invoicing and historic invoices on the customer portal, and features like Calendar Events which will help scheduling if your team are working shifts or remotely.

All of your data is stored on the latest Microsoft servers in their secure data centres, so you don’t need to worry about back-ups or power cuts.

We’ll share ideas for using Harbour Assist to support remote working and social distancing in our newsletter and on our website, but if we can help as you plan new working practices, please get in touch with Nick nick.gill@harbourassist.com

## Quick Pay

Not all customers want to register on our portal to pay their bill. We now support "quick pay" links which allow a customer to pay for an Order without registering nor logging into the portal.

Not only do customers not have to log in, they can use the same Vaulted Cards \(as long as they know their CV2 number\) as they do on the portal.

This link is embedded into our default email order template, along with a nice, friendly **Pay Now** button. _If you have customised your invoice email, let us know and we'll inject it for you_.

We have also integrated Quick-Pay into a "SMS Invoice" feature, to streamline visitor operations. We timed it and with a vaulted card, visitors can pay within 30 seconds of receiving their invoice SMS.

1. Customer receives SMS with quick-pay link.
2. Customer either uses vaulted card or enters new card.
3. Customer clicks on "Pay".

?&gt; Vaulted card features are only available for customers who use PaySafe gateway.

### Calendar Events

A highly requested feature; we now allow you to add arbitrary important events into the Occupancy Calendar, so they appear at the top letting the entire team know of important things to consider when booking people in.

**Built-in Sync.** Events can be exported to any online calendar, so you can have a single place to store your organisation-wide events; as you modify events in Harbour Assist, your synced calendars \(e.g. Google calendar\) are _automatically_ updated. We're hoping to expand this capability to include Tasks in upcoming releases.

### Xero Export support

A lot of people are moving to Xero. We now support exporting Credit Notes and Orders in the correct format to be imported.

### Cash "Change Calculator"

When customers pay for Orders in Cash, there is now a "Change Calculator" which means you don't need to be a mathematician to work out the change required.

### Historical Orders and Payments visible in the Portal

Customers can now see historical Orders and Payments in their Portal. This is the first of several expansions of the portal you'll be seeing in the coming months.

?&gt; This needs to be enabled on a per-customer basis as we're aware some customers don't want this to be shown. Drop us a ticket and we'll enable for you.

### Smaller Changes

**3D Secure upgrade** - we now support 3DS v2, which makes online purchasing less likely to be interrupted with a challenge to enter password/receive SMS.

**Letters Preview** - On Account Comms tab, Letters are now shown in the expanding panel in the same way as an email.

**Air Draft** - In hotter climates, berths are housed in shade. To allow searching for assets which fit the boat, we have expanded the Boat and the Asset records to support this capture, along with extending the availability search tools.
