# 2017.3

## v2017.3 - November\#\#

A significant release with a number of new features:

## New Homepage \#\#

We've tidied up the homepage and updated the search mechanism. The order of buttons has changed so that "Operational" tools are at the top, and less operational tools towards the bottom. A couple of notable differences:

* Account balances are now shown in search results, so you can quickly see if they owe.
* When you change the Search Type, the system re-searches based on what you've already searched for.
* The "All My Sites" tickbox has been replaced with a dropdown on the right.  This defaults to "All Sites".

## Mapping \#\#

Perhaps our most requested feature. We have integrated Occupancy \(who is on what Asset\), Licensing \(who is the permanent holder of an Asset\), Maintenance and Fault Management into visual maps. From the map you can:

* See who's on each Asset, whether they owe money, and when they are due to leave.
* Move & Depart Vessels.
* View overdue and upcoming Inspections.
* View, resolve and log Faults.

## Order Tooling Changes \#\#

* New tickbox on the Account "Orders" tab to filter Orders to only show Unpaid entries.
* "Credit out an Order".  New button at top of Order page \(and in cog-dropdown next to Order in Account "Orders" tab\) allows you to create a Credit-Note for an Order.  Allows ability to choose which items to credit, and allows any to be partially credited.
* You can now Add the same Tariff more than once per Order.  This fixes the limitation of being unable to invoice the same Tariff for multiple Vessels on a given Order.
* When emailing an Invoice or Order Receipt, you can now select any Email template or edit the body of the email directly rather than just sending fixed content.

## Smart List Improvements \#\#

Smart lists have proven to be a popular feature, so we've spent some time improving their usefulness.

**Locking** - Smart Lists can now be "Locked", this allows Smart Lists with complex criteria to be locked down so they don't get tampered with. Only Users with SmartListAdministrator permission can un-lock.

**Auditing** - By their nature, Smart Lists change over time as your customer-base changes. This characteristic makes it difficult when you want to look back in time and see "who was sent that batch of emails", or who was on it when it was downloaded to Excel. To address this, whenever an Action is performed against a Smart List, we take a snapshot of who did the Action, the Accounts that were included, and a sub-set of Account-level information.

**Bulk Email Tracking** - Bulk-emailing the members of a Smart List is one of Smart List's primary usages, but it was impossible to understand how effective these email batches were; i.e. how many emails were sent, how many have been opened, and if there were links in the email, were any clicked. We now provide a Bulk Email dashboard that shows you all of this information.

**New Criteria** - Added the following criteria:

* Occupancy Arrival Date
* Occupancy Departure Date
* Occupancy Type

These criteria make it trivial to send communications to / ask questions like: "All Visitors last Summer", "All Residents who started partway through season".

## Estimates \#\#

If a customer enquired about "how much would it cost for service X?", the only way of doing this was to create a Draft Order. This littered the customers Order History with Draft Orders that they may or may not take up. To address this, we have created the ability to create Estimates, which can if/when the Customer decides to take it up, be converted into a Draft Order. Estimates have the following characteristics:

* They are valid for a configurable number of days.  Once expired, they cannot be converted to a Draft Order.
* Expired Estimates can be "Regenerated" to a new Estimate, which will pick up any changes in pricing.
* Estimates can be emailed to Customers, and the email body can be edited.

## Email Improvements \#\#

**BCC/CC Support** - When composing ad-hoc emails, you can now CC and BCC as many people as you wish. If you want to CC another Harbour Assist User, you can select them from a dropdown and add them via a button-click rather than having to type in their email address.

**Image pasting** - When composing an email, you can now paste an image into the email editor & we'll upload and store on our servers so it appears in the email when the customer opens it.

## Embeddable Website Form \#\#

Most of our customers have a "Contact Us" form on their website. Typically this sends an email to someone who then enters them manually onto Harbour Assist. We now provide a "Contact Us" form that you can embed in your website and avoid having to re-type. It has the following features:

* If the customer selects an Enquiry Type of "Product/Service Enquiry", it will create a new "Lead" on Harbour Assist, creating a Task for someone at the appropriate Site to respond.
* For other Enquiry Types, an email is sent to a predefined emails address with their details.
* If the email address the person enters is already on Harbour Assist, a Task is created and assigned to the appropriate Team as defined against the Account's site.
* Email Addresses are verified as per entering a new Account manually.
* Postcode look-up is supported.

## Task Page Improvements \#\#

Tasks page has been re-built to allow:

* 2-paned navigation with calendar on left, and the Tasks for the selected week/month on the right \(list of Tasks will move under calendar if viewed on small device\).
* You can now filter by Task Type as well as Team & User, so you can examine all overdue / outstanding / upcoming Tasks by any combination of Task Type, User or Team.
* Calendar now supports dragging of Tasks for simple rescheduling.
* Page remembers what you were looking at and will now go to same view when you hit "back" button.
* Overdue Tasks are now paginated.

## Utility Invoicing \#\#

We have finally hooked up Utility Meter-reading & invoicing into this release. This allows you to configure Asset types to "Allow Meter Readings", take sporadic Meter Readings & draw them down into an invoice as required. It also allows you enter meter readings which are to be "excluded" from Invoicing Draw-down; this caters for scenarios where an Annual / longer-term customer leaves their berth and the Utility Meter is used for Visitors.

## Boat Check Indicator \#\#

A number of our customers perform Walk-arounds or Boat-checks from either the Occupancy Calendar or the Asset List by clicking on the coloured Occupancy bar and selecting "Boat Check - IN" or "Boat Check - OUT". It is difficult to keep track which ones have been checked. To help with this we have added an "eye" icon to these bars to indicate that a check has been done. The icon stays there for a configurable amount of time. If for example you do a Boat Check every week, then it may take you a day or 2 to survey the entire Site, so we would configure the icon to be visible for 2 days before disappearing.

## Other Changes \#\#

* Finally the tabs on the Account page now support back button, so you go back to the tab you were on rather than always going back to the 'Home' tab.
* Renewals now include Tariffs associated with an Account as well as those associated with the Account's Boats; useful for non-boat related services \(e.g. Locker rental\).   _This needs to be enabled so drop us a support ticket if you need to associate Tariffs with Accounts for annual/regular payment._
* Lookup Adminstration now caters for large number of lookups, which used to hang the page.
* Tasks on the top Navigation bar are now only retrieved when you open the box.  This should improve responsiveness.
* Smartlists grid has been upgraded to use a more modern interface.
* Occupancy calendar has been upgraded to a more modern interface with significant improvements in performance.
* Whenever we release a new version, you will be notified via a popup what changes are included, so you can take advantage of any new features.  Release notes are also available to peruse via the dropdown by your name at the top-right of the screen.
* When departing a Vessel early, you are clearly notified; aim to reduce human error departing boats before they were due to.
* Tracking mailbox now supports attachments.  NB: Only _safe_ attachments such as office documents are supported.
* New _docs_ mailbox allowing you to forward account documents \(e.g. insurance certs\) and they will appear in the "Documents" tab against the Account page.  Uses same Account matching mechanism as the email tracking mailbox.  **This will need to be set up, so drop us a ticket if you neeed** 

## Multi-Tenancy \#\#

We have re-architected the system so that Harbour Assist customers are served by the same Application cluster; this means we can:

* Get new features and bug fixes released to you quicker.
* Be 100% consistent with all customers using same version.
* Update configuration such as Account Types, Task Types & Invoice Templates without you having to wait for us to deploy config files.
* Speed up new HA customer on-boarding so we can maintain attention on existing customers & building new features.
