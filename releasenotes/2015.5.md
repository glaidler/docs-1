# 2015.5

## v2015.5 - November

### Moorings renamed to 'Assets'

A number of customers are using Moorings inspection engine to capture and track other items under their control, so we have re-named these to Assets to give a more broad use.

### Electricity Bollard & Meter Reading support

* If your harbour supports it \(contact us if you need it enabling\), you will see a new Mooring Type of "Electricity".  When a mooring is set to this, a new Tab appears showing Meter Readings.  This allows you to capture incremental meter readings and "Drawdown" them to generate an order.  The Drawdown uses the Tariffs associated with the Mooring.
* When you drawdown meter readings, a "Preview" of the Order that is going to be generated is displayed to allow you to predict / double-check the amount.

### Small Changes

* Added ability to download Reports \(that don't have parameters\) directly from the Report List.  Saves some button clicks.

### Bug fixes

* Chat window was re-opening when you closed your browser after telling it to remain closed.
* Order page screen jump resolved.
