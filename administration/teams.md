# Teams

## Overview

_Teams_ on Harbour Assist are used for the sole purpose of setting _Tasks_ and each _User_ can belong to an unlimited number of _Teams_.

_Teams_ can be added, removed and administered, and _Users_ can be added and removed from a _Team_ by users with the appropriate permissions.

?&gt; NB. Permissions required are TeamAdministration and AdministrationUsers.

## Adding a Team

If the _Team_ has any members these will need removing before you can delete the _Team_. Just click on the _Remove_ button of each member.
