You can now update and amend their details, add them into a Team\(s\) \(used when setting team Tasks\), add or remove sites they can access, set their Home Site \(this is the site that the system will default to when they log in\) and set their Role \(their permissions on the system are set according to their role\).

## Managing Existing Users

As Harbour Assist can be accessed via any device \(at home or at work\) it is important to manage your Users as situations change.

You have two options when managing Users - _Set to InActive_ or _Delete_.

_Set to InActive_ - this is mainly used for seasonal staff. You would set them to inactive during the winter months so that they cannot access the system whilst they are not employed.

![image-20200513150342444](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200513150342444.png)

![image-20200513145814802](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200513145814802.png)

When they return to work for the following season you can reverse this by clicking the _Set to Active_ button.

![image-20200513150238771](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200513150238771.png)

_Delete_ - a user should be deleted if they leave and it is anticipated they will not return.

![image-20200513150621524](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200513150621524.png)

![image-20200513150655819](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200513150655819.png)

## To Add a New User

From the _Users_ screen, select _New User_.

![image-20200513152549979](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200513152549979.png)

Complete the Users details, set the Team\(s\) they will be in and the Site\(s\) they should have access to. You will also need to set a password - this can be anything as the User can change this at their first login.

Once complete, click _Register_ at the bottom of the page.

![image-20200513152957211](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200513152957211.png)

This will take you to the User details page where you can add a mobile number \(if appropriate\), set their Home Site \(this should be the Site where the User is based \(multi-site operators only\)\) and set their Role\(s\). \(their permissions on the system are set according to their Role\). Then click _Save_.

## Roles and Permissions \#\#

There are various Roles within Harbour Assist and each _Role_ has a set of Permissions that enables Users to carry out functions on the system. Each User should be assign the appropriate Role \(set of permissions\) to enable them to carry out all the functions they need in their day to day job.

You can access _Roles_ from the _Administion_ tile on the _Home_ screen.

![image-20200512154151675](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200512154151675.png)

Select _Roles_

![image-20200513153700332](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200513153700332.png)

This will show you all the Roles that have been set up, the Permissions within that Role and the Members \(Users\) that have been set up in that Role. To make changes within the Role, click on the _Actions_ button against the Role you wish to edit and select _Edit_.

![image-20200513160117549](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200513160117549.png)

The Role that you are editing is shown at the top of the screen and you can check and uncheck each permission as required.

?&gt; NB. Any changes made to Roles or Permissions within the Role will not take effect until the User logs out of the system and back in again.
