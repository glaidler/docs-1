# Lookups \#

Lookups are the drop down lists that appear on the Account and Boat Details pages - they are there to help speed up the process of entering data.

You can add to and edit the Lookups by accessing them through the Administration tile on the _Home_ page.

Select the Lookup list that you wish to edit or add to by clicking on the name. In this example we are adding to _Account Archive Reasons_. You will be shown the full details of that Lookup list. To add to the list click on _New Lookup_.

Add the detail as you wish it to appear in the drop down list - the Display and Value cells should normally have the same information entered. The click _Save_.
