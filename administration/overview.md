# Overview

Much of the set up and configuration of Harbour Assist can be maintained and updated by high level users \(normally those with the Role of System Manager\) and this can be accessed by using the _Administration_ tile on the Home page.

?&gt; NB: The ability to access the Administration of the system is permission based. Depending on your permissions you may be able to access some aspects and not others.
