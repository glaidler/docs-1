# Dealing with Leavers

Inevitably as new customers arrive, you will also have those that leave. Dealing with leavers in the appropriate way is important to keep your records up to date, ensure they don't receive charges for services in error and that you don't continue to send them information that may no longer be appropriate \(notification of new access codes etc\).

Most marinas/harbours require customers to give a notice period, so you will need to record their intention to leave \(or not renew\) on Harbour Assist. There are a couple of ways that you can do this:-

* The creation a **Task** on the Account - you could have a specific Task Type for this.  You would set the Task to the relevant User or Team for the date of departure so that it appeared in their Task notifications at the appropriate time.  They could then carry out all the actions required at the departure date \(see below for suggested actions\).
* Manage leavers by **Renewal Group** - you could set up Renewal Groups called Non-Renewal, Leaver end of March, Leaver end of June etc depending on your contract periods ie. are they all annual from 1st April, or could they start at any point in the year.  The names of the Renewal Groups are entirely up to you and these can be set up in Lookups.  When the customer notifies you they are leaving, set the Renewal Group on the boat to the appropriate 'leaving' one.  You can identify all boats in that Renewal Group by the creation of a Smart List.  By viewing the Smart List you can then carry out all the actions required for each boat/account at their departure date \(see below for suggested actions\).
