# Assets \#

An Asset within Harbour Assist can be anything, not just a berth or mooring. Electricity meters, Meeting Rooms, Lockers and items of Plant etc can all be an Asset.

## Asset Types \#\#

To set up a new _Asset Type_, from the _Home_ screen select _Administration_.

Set the _Licence Level_ and the _Permitted Occupancy Types_ - these are the types of occupancy that you will be able to put on the Asset.

## Asset Areas & Regions \#\#

Each Asset created needs to be located within an _Area & Region_ - this will help you to find an individual Asset from the Occupancy, Asset Tiles and Asset Tools screens. Each Region within a Site can have multiple Areas. Each Region represents a blue button at the top of these screens, and each Area is a drop-down entry when you click on the "down arrow" against these buttons.

To set us a new _Area or Region_, from the _Home_ page select _Administration_.

![image-20191223130746762](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223130746762.png)

Then select _Sites_.

![image-20191223132021219](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223132021219.png)

Select the Site that you want to create the new Area or Region for by clicking on the site name.

![image-20191223133840626](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223133840626.png)

Within the _Site_ screen you will find _Asset Areas & Regions_.

![image-20191223134004082](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223134004082.png)

To add a new _Region_, click on the + icon.

![image-20191223134103450](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223134103450.png)

Give the _Region_ a name and click OK.

![image-20191223134155082](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223134155082.png)

Now you can set the _Areas_ within the _Region_. First ensure you have selected the _Region_ that you are setting an _Area_ for, then click on the + icon.

![image-20191223134312640](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223134312640.png)

Give the _Area_ a name and click OK.

![image-20191223134407027](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223134407027.png)

You can add as many _Areas_ to a _Region_ as you wish.

![image-20191223134445731](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223134445731.png)

The new _Region_ will show in the blue tiles on the Occupancy, Asset Tiles, Asset Tools and Mapping screens and any _Areas_ will show in the drop down options.

?&gt; NB: You may need to sign out and back into Harbour Assist for the new Region/Area to show.

## Creating a New Asset \#\#

Once your Asset Types, Areas and Regions are set up you can create a new Asset.

From the _Home_ page, select _Asset Tools_.

![image-20191223135719747](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223135719747.png)

Then click on _Asset List_.

![image-20191223135825432](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223135825432.png)

Click on _New Asset_.

![image-20191223140150137](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223140150137.png)

Give the Asset a name and complete the rest of the screen by using the drop down options. When you have finished click on _Save_.

?&gt; NB: Inspection Regime is not a mandatory field and only needs to be populated if you want to carry out routine inspections on the asset.

![image-20191223140444095](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223140444095.png)

In the _Asset Details_ screen you can add more detailed information, such as maximum sizes and any notes.

![image-20191223140702755](../.gitbook/assets/image-20191223140702755.png)

Your new Asset will now be visible in the Occupancy, Asset Tiles and Asset Tools screens.
