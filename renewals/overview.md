# Overview \#

The Renewal engine in Harbour Assist enables the user to select a group of customers and bulk create/generate invoices which can then be emailed or printed.

In order for the Renewal engine to work successfully certain data is required to be 'attached' to a craft:-

* License
* Allocated Tariff
* Renewal Group

This information will form the basis of the Invoice and Occupancy that will be created.
