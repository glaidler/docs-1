# Account Dashboard

The Account Dashboard is the first page you see when viewing an account and it gives you an overview of the information contained within each tab on the Account.

For each section you can click through to the Tab by selecting the *See all* option.

In the *Account Summary* section there is a quick link to send an email or SMS to the customers without having to go into the Comms tab.
