# Instalment Plans

An Instalment Plan is a pre-configured template which can be used to generate individual Payment Schedules as required. An Instalment Plan consists of:

* The name of the Plan
* A table of Month number / percentage combinations which define how the value will be broken down over time.
* Which Tariffs are allowed to be included when a Schedule is being created.
* Email + File Attachments to standardise how the customer is communicated their contractual obligations.

## Creating an Instalment Plan

Navigate to _Administration_ &gt; _Instalment Plans_

You will be taken to the list of existing plans, where you can view existing or create a new one.

Creating a new Instalment Plan will prompt you to enter:

**Name:** The friendly name of the Plan - e.g. "12 Month Resdiential"

**Order Type:** The Order Type which will be used when generating the monthly Orders.

**Number of Months**: Over how many months will the cost be split.

**Schedule**: Here you can define which months should be included in the Plan. The % split wil be automatically calculated for you. Here you can add creativity to how the balance is paid. e.g.

* Quarterly: Tick Months 1, 4, 7, 10.
* Split over first 10 months of year: Tick Months 1-10.

Now you can add the Tariffs that are available to use for the Instalment Plan \(often different charges are applied if a customer is paying over instalments, so you don't want a User to be able to select a Tariff that is for a single payment charge\).

Click on the _Tariffs_ tab.

Select the Tariffs by filtering to a _Tariff Category_ and then clicking the _Add_ button.
