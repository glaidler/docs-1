Introduction of GDPR tools to help you manage your customers' Consent.  We've also added a load of email tools while we were visiting that part of the system.

# GDPR Tools #

Each of HA’s Customers will define their own Consent Groups (see Administration Changes below). Once Consent Groups are defined, Customers can opt in or out of any of them. For example, a Customer may have the following Consent Groups:

- Marketing
- 3rd Party Marketing
- Receive our Newsletter

we have extended the Account page to allow Users to edit an Account’s opt-ins to any Consent Group. e.g:

![Consent Groups](http://help.harbourassist.com/site/releaseNotes/img/2018.2/ConsentGroups.png)

All changes to Consent Group preferences will be audited with a permanent record of who modified the preference and when.  These can be viewed by selecting the Actions key and View History.

# Smart List Improvements #

A re-write of the SmartList engine has lead to a 10x performance improvement.  We've also introduced a large number of changes to help you use Smart lists for bulk communications.  

All "Communication Actions" (specifically Bulk Email, Bulk Mail Merge and Bulk SMS) now allow you to specify which Consent Groups you would like to restrict dispatch to.  

![Consent Groups](http://help.harbourassist.com/site/releaseNotes/img/2018.2/ConsentGroups1.png)

This allows bulk-communicating with any combination of Consent Groups.
The only communications that can be sent without selecting one or more Consent Groups are operational.  So, if none were selected, we have added a prompt informing the end-user that the Communication must be of an operational nature.   This is for auditing purposes.

### Email Footer ###

If any Consent Groups are ticked, we will inject a footer at the bottom of each Email allowing individuals to manage their Consent. E.g.:

*“You are receiving this email from {Organisation Name} as you have chosen to receive Communications relating to {Consent Group Name}. If you would like to change your preferences, click here.”*

The curly brackets placeholders will be replaced with the appropriate values. The link will take the Individual to a page where they can opt In or Out of any Consent Group. The Individual will not have to log into the Portal to see this page, making it as easy as possible for them to control their settings.
We have also created an email “Merge Tag” that points to the individuals’ Consent Group management page, so an initial bulk email can be sent to capture initial consent.

### Bulk Email ###

We needed to spend a lot of time to incorporate the GDPR consent links, so we took the time to add a number of features we've been asked for a number of times.

- Added ability to include statement(s) as attachments.
- Added ability to include any documents from your Document Library.  These will have account information merged in based on who the email is being sent to.
- Added richer "Snippets" and "Fields" insertion into the body of the email.  This allows you to both include fields from the Account as well as a table showing outstanding Orders.  The list of these will expand over time.
- All Emails will automatically have a footer added to allow the customer to modify their Consent-Group settings.  The actual content of this footer will depend on whether the email was sent to one or more Consent groups or whether it was operational.

## Customer Ad-hoc Emails ##

As per the bulk email engine, we've added the ability to add a multitude of attachments, along with the ability to include any Order docs from the Account; this avoids having to download and attach manually.

## Order Emails ##

Added the ability to include all the standard attachments as listed above along with:

- Any other Invoice.
- Any Order Document from your Document Library - e.g. berthing contract, which will have the Order information for the current Order merged in.  This allows Berthing contracts to be issued part-way through the berthing season and the same document to be generated as per the renewal process.

## Improved Search ##

Searches always used to take you to the Account page, so when using the "Asset" or "Plaque" Search, it took you to the License-holder or Owners account page.  This meant that the end user would have then navigate to the correct tab and do further navigation to get to the place they probably wanted to get to.  This was a legacy of how search evolved over the years.

We have modified this so that the different Search Types take you to the correct place.  Specifically:

- General => Account Page
- Account => Account Page
- Boat => Boat Page
- Asset => Asset Page
- Plaque => Boat Page
- Visitor => Acccount Page

### Default Search ###

You can now set the Search to default to the Search Type you use most frequently.  Under your User Name (where you log out) you will see 'Your Profile'. Choose the Search Type by using the drop down list and Save.  

## Signature/Declaration Support ##

There are a number of scenarios where a Customer may be required to declare their understanding of terms and conditions; for example when declaring Fuel Duty split, or Terms & Conditions of Berthing.  We now allow you to enable the capture of a signature and display of a Declaration against specific Order Types.  If enabled, when an Order is created, the declaration is displayed on the Order page, and button allows the capture of the Customer's signature via an iPad or mouse.

- Once captured, both the signature and declaration is shown in the Invoice.  If no signature has been captured, a box is shown on the Invoice PDF so the Customer can sign on paper if required.  Note, this is only shown if you use our "Default" templates; for custom Templates, this is not supported.
- Once an order is Confirmed, the signature is locked.
- When the Signature is electronically captured, we store who captured it, a timestamp and IP address.  This provides a degree of auditing should it be questioned.

Note, these extensions are only supported if you use our "Default" templates; for custom Templates, they are not supported.

## Invoice Options extended ##

A limitation of the current Invoice Generation was that any allocated payments against the Order weren't listed.  To alleviate this, we have added the ability to choose whether these are included.  Likewise, if the Order Type has support for Declarations (see above) then this can also be included.  
Note, these extensions are only supported if you use our "Default" templates; for custom Templates, they are not supported.

## Document Types & Document Expiration ##

To allow HA to categorise documents that are uploaded against an Account, there are now the concept of Document Types.  An examples of Document Types could be "Insurance Certificates".  Account Document Types are configurable via the Administration area.  Each Document Type can have expiry duration configured against it consisiting of a number of days, weeks, months and years.  

When a document is uploaded, its Expiry Date is calculated & this is then flagged as and when it becomes expired.  

When a user uploads a new Document, you can opt to replace the previous version, allowing you to quickly see the current version of a given Document Type as well as historical versions.

We've also integrated this into the ability to send docs to the docs* tracking mailbox.  By specifying a "Mailbox suffix" to the Document Type, you can set up different mailboxes for each Document Type.  We'll automatically set up a Document Type of "Insurance Certificate" with a mailbox suffix of "certs".  This means that any attachments sent to **docs-certs@your-tenant.harbourassist.com** will be attached to the account with a Document Type of "Certificates".

## Boat Relationship ##

A boat can now have a relationship with more than one Account.  This means that a co-owner or skipper etc can now be 'connected' with a boat so that one off purchases of fuel for example can be invoiced to the correct Account without the boat being duplicated in the system.  'Other Parties' can be added via the Boat page.

## Security Changes ##

**Sliding Session Expiration**

Previously users were logged out of Harbour Assist 24 hours after they logged in (or a different duration if requested).  It would then pop up with a (admittedly annoying) popup that sometimes took you back to the same page, but sometimes not (we were victims of a component not behaving!).  This has been replaced with "Sliding Session Expiration" which means you'll remain logged in as long as you are using the application.  After 1 hour of inactivity, you will be automatically logged out and reverted to the login page.  When you log back in, you'll go back to the page you were at. 

**User Lockout after 10 attempts**

To protect against brute-force attacks, if a user (whether it's a member of staff or a Customer) uses incorrect username/password for 10 sequential attempts, they are Locked Out.  There are 2 ways to unlock the account:

- By requesting a password reset link and updating their password.
- By a Harbour Assist user unlocking their account.  How this is done depends on whether they are a member of Staff, or a Customer.  

	- A member of staff will need to be unlocked via their User administration page; so this will need to be done by someone with appropriate permissions.  
	- For customers, a member of staff can navigate to their Account page.  There is a clear banner showing they are locked out, and a button to unlock them.

## Administration Changes ##

- We have changed the "Word Templates" administration section to be called "Document Library" to reflect how it's used.  Each Template now has a type which indicates where it is shown.
- Management of Consent Groups is available in the "Communication and Document Tools" section.
	
## Smaller Changes ##

- Downloading a smart list now includes extended custom fields, which were previously ignored.
- Email History was taking a long time to display.
- Improved performance when viewing an Account's Communication History.
- New Icons - site upgraded to Fontawesome 5 Pro.
