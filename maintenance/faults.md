# Faults \#

Harbour Assist provides tools to allow you to log Faults against Assets, and tools to manage these through to resolution. Logging a Fault can be done at any time on an Asset - you don't have to be carrying out an Inspection.

To instruction about logging a Fault as part of an Inspection please click below.

?&gt; More documentation [here](https://github.com/glaidler/docs-1/tree/a9b2fde53025657e319d99966ea9a02a32cbd61d/Maintenance/Maintenance/PerformingAnInspection.md).

## Logging a Fault \#\#

To log a fault on an Asset, from the _Home_ page select _Asset Tools_.

Then select _Asset Administration_.

You now need to find that Asset that needs a fault logging against it - remember to check the _Include Unusable_ box to show all Assets and then filter the screen using the blue filter tiles.

Once you have found your Asset, you can open this Asset by either clicking on the Asset name or by selecting _View/Edit_ in the green _Actions_ box.

A _Log Fault_ window opens up which you need to complete.

* Select the fault severity \(high, medium or low\) 
* Tick if you want to create a task - NB: the Task Details part of the screen will only appear if you tick to create a task
* Add a description of the fault
* Add what action is required.  

If you have selected to create a task, check and complete the Task Details part of the screen.

Now click on the _Save_ button.

All the detail of the Fault can be seen and edited in this screen - you may needs to change the Severity of the Fault etc.
