# Inspection Assets \#

Any Asset can have an Inspection Regime attached to it, however there may be a number of Assets that need to be set up in Harbour Assist for the sole purpose of carrying out Inspections.

These _Inspection Assets_ can be set up individually in the same way as any Asset, however if a bulk upload of _Inspections Assets_ is required please contact the team at Harbour Assist by raising a Help ticket.

?&gt; More documentation [here](https://github.com/glaidler/docs-1/tree/a9b2fde53025657e319d99966ea9a02a32cbd61d/Maintenance/AssetsOccupancy/Assets?id=creating-a-new-asset.md).

When creating the Asset you can select which Inspection Regime should be carried out on this Asset.

If the Asset is being used for inspection purposes only \(it is not a sellable asset\) check the Unusable box - this will turn the Asset red and it won't be counted in any occupancy figures.

?&gt; NB: For Unusable Assets to show on your Asset Search screen, you will need to check the _Include Unusable_ checkbox. They will show highlighted in Red.
