# Tasks \#

## What are Tasks \#\#

Tasks are a 'job, instruction or action' and can be related to any item on Harbour Assist \(Boat, Account, Asset or Order\). They can be used to ask a User or Team to contact the account holder, make changes to an Account or Order, carry out maintenance to an Asset, to alert a user of a problem with an Asset that requires repair etc. They are assigned to a User or a Team and are tracked through to completion.

Viewing the tasks of a User or Team can help with workload management - you can see what they need to do on a daily basis via an outlook-style calendar.

## Task Elements \#\#

There are a number of elememts to a task, some of these should be set when creating a task:-

* Title - this will be set automatically if a Task is associated to a Boat, Account, Asset or Order.
* Type - this should be chosen from the drop down choices.
* Due date - an appropriate due date should be chosen, taking into account working days, urgency of the task and workload.
* Assignment - who the task is for - setting for a User or a Team.
* Association - if a Task is set via an Account, Boat, Asset or Order page it will automatically be associated to that item.  If you wish to manually associate a task to an item  this can be done by selecting the _'Add'_ button and then searching for the Boat, Asset or Customer Name and selecting _Save_.
