# Notes

## Adding a Note to an Account

You can add notes to a customer account for other users to see (these are not visible to the customer in their Account Portal).  Notes could be something such as 'going out cruising for the whole of August'.  To do this, click on the *Notes* tab and then  *Add New Note*.

Type your note and click *Save*.

This will 'lock' the note, showing the date if was entered and who entered the note.  Once saved, Notes can only be edited or deleted by Users with the relevant permission (normally System Managers).

## Adding a Note to a Boat

You can also add a note to the *Boat Details* page - this is done in exactly the same way and should be used if a note relates particularly to the boat rather than the account.
