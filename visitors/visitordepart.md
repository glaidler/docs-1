# Managing Visitors \#

## Overview \#\#

When dealing with Visiting craft, customers will inevitably change their minds, therefore the _Visitor Depart_ function has been developed to:-

* Allow customers to change their mind and the system re-calculate what they owe,
* ensure that all visitor revenue is captured. 

For this function to work correctly, all Visitor Occupancies must now be _Departed_.

To manage your Visitors, from the _Home_ page, select _Visitor Depart_.

![image-20200430164201639](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200430164201639.png)

In the _Visitor Depart_ screen, ensure the correct site is selected \(for multi-site operators\). The screen will automatically populate to show all **Asset Types** that are currently **Occupied** with a **Visitor** occupancy and historic Visitor Occupanices who have not yet been marked as Departed.

?&gt; NB. To view Visitors who may be on Unusable Assets, please ensure you check the _Include Unusable_ box.

![image-20200512114816827](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200512114816827.png)

The symbols in the _Depart_ column mean you can easily see craft who are due to leave that day, the next day or who have _overstayed_ their original intended occupancy.

![image-20200512114932417](../.gitbook/assets/image-20200512114932417.png)

The Order details are shown - **Order** Number and Status \(Confirmed or Draft\), **Cost**, how much has been **Paid**, **Outstanding** amount and **Payment** status.

If a Visitor Occupancy has been created and no order raised, the Visitor will show and there will be a _New Visitor Order_ button showing in the Order/Schedule column. Use this to raise a Visitor Order for the Occupancy.

## Departing and Amending Visitor Occupancies \#\#

Using the _Actions_ button and _Depart/Amend_ for each Visitor you can Depart, Amend and update their Occupancy and Order.
