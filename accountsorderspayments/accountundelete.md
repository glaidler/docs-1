# Account Undelete

Even though the ability to delete an Account is Permissions based \(and normally limited to Users with high level Permissions\), there may still be instances where Accounts are deleted in error. To mitigate this there is, hidden in the depths of Administration, an Account Undelete function.

?&gt; Access to Account Undelete is also Permission based and the Permission required is **AdministrationDataTools**.

To Undelete an Account, from the _Home_ screen select _Administration_.

The Accounts will display in date order with the most recently deleted at the top. Find the Account that needs to be restored and click on _Undelete_.

This will restore the Account in its entirety and you will be able to find it by searching in the usual way from the _Home_ page.
