# Boat Relationships

A boat can have a relationship with more than one Account. This means that a co-owner or skipper etc can be 'connected' with a boat so that purchases of fuel for example can be invoiced to the correct Account without the boat being duplicated in the system and anyone with a relationship to the boat can be cc'd on correspondence.

Boat Relationships can be added to two ways:-

## Adding a Boat Relationship via the Boat
